a web/mobile app that: 
  1.reads wellness signals from your phone (steps, active minutes, sleep), 
  2.runs a quick health check with an LLM (“are you trending ok?”),  
  3.gives friendly, non-medical suggestions (“sleep looks low this week; try wind-down at 10:30pm”),  
  4.if risk looks high, suggests seeing a clinician and lists nearby doctors in the U.S.
